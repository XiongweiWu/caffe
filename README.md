### In short

Reimplement Shifeng's ICCV paper. The result is comparable to the original paper with single scale input.($93.2%$, $91.7%$ ,$80.4%$). I keep the original aspect ratio of images in inference phrase and remove extremely small faces in training. The results code is somehow ugly.

Installation step is the same as SSD, thanks to Shifeng's extremely kind help.
